MediaMover

This tool is designed to simplify the task of synchronizing music (or                   
really any files) between linux machines.  It uses ssh to get directory listings, and copy
files back and forth.  It stores machine name, port and username, for convenience. It expects 
media files to be stored in a standard format, with album names (or season name) as the directory.
It also scrubs the list of files on the local machine, and removes any directories (ie: albums)      
that you already have locally.  This tool serves a very specific purpose, and generally isn't 
very useful.  It does have a colored menu, is easy to use and services its specific purpose well.
Written in Python, using paramiko for ssh, and jsonpickle to serialize the config file.
